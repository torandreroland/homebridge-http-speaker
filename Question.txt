I was unable to add an issue, So I create a file here..... 

Is there any way to use hostname instead ip address?? my sony str dn 1080 registers on network using chromecast.local hostname (and I cannot change it)

I understand you disabled autodiscovery, but I think using hostname is a better option than ip.

In my case everytime I reset wifi router, devices kates different address by DHCP.. so my receiver changes IP often.
